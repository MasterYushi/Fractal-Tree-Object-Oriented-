#Object Oriented Fractal Tree :

Check it out in action [HERE](https://masteryushi.github.io/Fractal-Tree-Object-Oriented-/)

If you make an interesting pattern, be sure to share it with me!

This project is made by me as a hobby. It takes an object oriented approach towards building a fractal tree from branch objects and 
is built off and inspired from [Daniel Shiffmann's](https://github.com/shiffman) p5 projects, it takes its base from his code and extends
it providing more customization for you to mess around with and some other features. You can check out his youtube channel [here.](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman)

##Why not recursion?
Taking the object oriented approach over the more trivial **recursive** one allows for much more messing around as each branch is a seperate object.
This opens up a lot of possibilities for aminations and other stuff which wouldn't be possible with a recursive approach.

##Get Involved!
I develop this as a hobby, as stated above, and I add features/ideas whenever they come to me. Also, if you have an idea, or a feature request,
I would love to hear about it! You can file it in the [**issues**](https://github.com/MasterYushi/Fractal-Tree-Object-Oriented-/issues) 
section and I'll try to implement it if I can!

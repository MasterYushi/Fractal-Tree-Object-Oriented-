# Object Oriented Fractal Tree :

This project is made by me as a hobby using the [**p5.js**](p5js.org) library. It takes an object oriented approach towards building a fractal tree from branch objects and is built off and inspired from [**Daniel Shiffmann's**](https://github.com/shiffman) p5 projects, it takes its base from his code and extends it providing more customization for you to mess around with and some other features. You can check out his youtube channel [here.](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman)

See the Tree Generator in action [**HERE**](https://masteryushi.github.io/Fractal-Tree-Object-Oriented-/)

#### With so many customization options, you can end up with something that doesn't look like a tree at all!
If you end up with an interesting pattern (it doesn't have to be a tree!), be sure to share it with me!

##Why not recursion?
Taking the object oriented approach over the more trivial **recursive** one allows for much more messing around as each branch is a seperate object.
This opens up a lot of possibilities for animations and other stuff which wouldn't be possible with a recursive approach.

## Get Involved!
I developed this as a hobby, as stated above, and I add features/ideas whenever they come to me. Also, if you have an idea, or a feature request, I would love to hear about it! You can file it in the [**issues**](https://github.com/MasterYushi/Fractal-Tree-Object-Oriented-/issues) section and I'll try to implement it if I can! Also, thanks to my friend [**Simran**](https://github.com/xxxZeus) for helping me with the styling of the webpage and the html/css parts! Check out his projects [here.](https://github.com/xxxZeus)
